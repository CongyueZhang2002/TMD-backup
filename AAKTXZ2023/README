To make the FIT replicas from scratch:
./make_reps.x

To run the FIT replicas use:
./rep_fit.x

To make the PREDICT replicas from scratch:
./make_reps_pred.x

To make the COLLINEAR UNCERTAINTY replicas from scratch:
./make_reps_col.x

To update the main routine to FIT in each replica use:
./cp_fits.x

To update the main routine to PREDICT in each replica use:
./cp_predicts.x

To remove the replicas use:
./rm_reps.x

To update readdatas use:
./copy_readdatas.py

To collect the chi2 and parameter values from each FIT replica use:
python collect_results.py 

To collect all plot data into plots/data_reps use:
./collect_reps.x

To collect all plot data into plots/data_reps_col use:
./collect_reps_col.x

To update the subroutines, you only need to modify the subroutine files in
the fit directory.
