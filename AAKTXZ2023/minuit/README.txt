These libraries are part of the ITERATE code writen by J. Pumplin.

They should be compiled in the machine where they are going to be used by:
	gfortran -c ./*.F
One could get warnings, but that's fine. No errors should appear.

The *.o files should be compiled together with the code that calls minuit.
